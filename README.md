# Telecom_Customer_Churn
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer data to understand churn behavior and identify key factors that influence a customerâ€™s decision to leave the service. The dataset includes over 243,000 records with demographic and behavioral information such as call activity, SMS usage, and internet consumption.
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

    Explore and analyze customer data to discover patterns related to churn.

    Identify key features that contribute most to customer attrition.

    Build predictive models to forecast churn risk.

    Provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

ðŸ§¾ Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

    customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.

    telecom_partner: Service provider (e.g., Jio, Vodafone, BSNL).

    gender: Customer gender (M/F).

    age: Age of the customer.

    state, city: Geographical location.

    pincode: Postal code.

    date_of_registration: Registration date.

    num_dependents: Number of dependents.

    estimated_salary: Estimated annual salary.

    calls_made, sms_sent, data_used: Communication and data usage metrics.

    churn: Target variable (1 = churned, 0 = retained).

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

    Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

    Jupyter Notebook

    Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and machine learning models)
